In this paper, a novel deep learning-based framework is proposed for efficient design and optimization of a 5G A2G network. The devised architecture comprises two deep neural networks (DNNs): the first DNN is used for approximating the 5G A2G network behavior in terms of user throughput, and the second DNN is developed as a function optimizer to find the throughput-optimal deployment parameters including antenna up-tilt angles and inter-site distances. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed model and reveal system-level design insights.","tags":[],"title":"5G Air-to-Ground Network Design and Optimization: A Deep Learning Approach","type":"chosen_project"},{"authors":["Yun Chen","Nuria González-Prelcic","Robert W.

We propose a novel handover framework for providing efficient mobility support and reliable wireless connectivity to drones served by a terrestrial cellular network. Using tools from deep reinforcement learning, we develop a deep Q-learning algorithm to dynamically optimize handover decisions to ensure robust connectivity for drone users. Simulation results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the number of handovers at the expense of a small loss in signal strength.","tags":[],"title":"A Deep Learning Approach to Efficient Drone Mobility Support","type":"chosen_project"},{"authors":["Yun Chen","Nuria González-Prelcic","Robert W.

Object detection is incorporated to reduce flight time and to remove the impact of wrong predictions from the deep network. Comparing with traditional RL methods, the scheme reduces flying times towards given destinations by 25%, and cuts down 50% of unnecessary turns.","tags":[],"title":"Collision-free UAV Navigation with a Monocular Camera Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"chosen_project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588813790,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588813790,"objectID":"1aa3bc14a81f4cf9a860bd8e499bf30f","permalink":"https://yunchen.com/chosen_project/wcnc20/","publishdate":"2020-05-06T19:09:50-06:00","relpermalink":"/chosen_project/wcnc20/","section":"chosen_project","summary":"To date, existing mobile networks have been primarily designed and optimized for serving ground UEs, thus making the mobility support in the sky challenging. In this paper, a novel handover (HO) mechanism is developed for a cellular-connected drone system to ensure robust wireless connectivity and mobility support for drone-UEs. By leveraging tools from reinforcement learning, HO decisions are dynamically optimized using a Q-learning algorithm to provide an efficient mobility support in the sky. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce (e.g., by 80%) the number of HOs, while maintaining connectivity.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Drone Mobility Support Using Reinforcement Learning","type":"chosen_project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"https://yunchen.com/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"40ea366a28f9524de71378c3212c5489","permalink":"https://yunchen.com/publication/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
