title: "Efficient Drone Mobility Support Using Reinforcement Learning"
summary: "To date, existing mobile networks have been primarily designed and optimized for serving ground UEs, thus making the mobility support in the sky challenging. In this paper, a novel handover (HO) mechanism is developed for a cellular-connected drone system to ensure robust wireless connectivity and mobility support for drone-UEs. By leveraging tools from reinforcement learning, HO decisions are dynamically optimized using a Q-learning algorithm to provide an efficient mobility support in the sky. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce (e.g., by 80%) the number of HOs, while maintaining connectivity."
