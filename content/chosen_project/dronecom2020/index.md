title: "A Deep Learning Approach to Efficient Drone Mobility Support"
summary: "Existing cellular networks targeting terrestrial usage can support the initial deployment of low-altitude drone users with some challenges. We propose a novel handover framework for providing efficient mobility support and reliable wireless connectivity to drones served by a terrestrial cellular network. Using tools from deep reinforcement learning, we develop a deep Q-learning algorithm to dynamically optimize handover decisions to ensure robust connectivity for drone users. Simulation results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the number of handovers at the expense of a small loss in signal strength."
