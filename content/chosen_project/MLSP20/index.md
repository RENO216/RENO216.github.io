title: "Collision-free UAV Navigation with a Monocular Camera Using Deep Reinforcement Learning"
summary: "A navigation system based on object detection and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that only exploits sensing data obtained by a monocular camera mounted on the UAV. Object detection is incorporated to reduce flight time and to remove the impact of wrong predictions from the deep network. Comparing with traditional RL methods, the scheme reduces flying times towards given destinations by 25%, and cuts down 50% of unnecessary turns."
