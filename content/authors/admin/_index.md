I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NC State University. I'm supervised by Prof. Nuria Gonz√°lez-Prelcic, the director of Wireless Sensing and Communication Lab (WiSeCom), and work on sensor fusion and machine learning based wireless communications for automated vehicles.

Before this I received M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. I worked in Wireless Systems Innovation Laboratory (WSIL) and supervised by Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr. My research topics were about UAV navigation systems based on deep learning, sensor functions, etc.  


<!-- Now my research interest lies in V2X communication technologies using deep learning. -->
